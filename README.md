Console app project for university assignment

Contributors:
- To define new behaviour of the app add/adjust existing states
- Functions to define/adjust are self explainatory
- Class AllTexts will contain namespaces for all states
- New state has to be added in the enum in StatesConf class
- States Wrapper wraps up all states, so contains only includes
- Right now all states has to define variable for containing user prompt, later it'll be changed to Singleton probably
- You can define changes in states in function update or exit
- in function start you want to prepare canva (terminal) for your needs
  Have fun :)
