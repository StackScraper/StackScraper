Hello,

for contributors:

This app is made via VSC.

Also you can install C/C++ extensions from Extensions in VSC for your own pleasure.

Also if you get segmentation fault error while compiling, try entering VSC via Developer Command Line for VSC, at least for me it works.
I am compiling using MSVC, cl.exe since gcc produced segmentation fault.
